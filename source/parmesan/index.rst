History
-------

Parmesan Cheese originated in the Italian provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena,
Bologna and Mantua around 900 years ago. These regions are known for their grass-fed cows
and thus high quality milk full of nutrients. In fact it is regulated that for a cheese to be called parmesan
it must be produced from cow's milk and aged for at least 10 months.
In some stricter cases, it must be produced from grass or hay fed cows.

Parmesan is `'considered to be among the top cheeses by cheese connoisseurs' <https://www.cheese.com/parmesan/>`_ .
It is used in a number of pasta dishes, grated over soups and salads,
or can be eaten on its own as a snack. It is a staple for charcuterie boards!

As a reminder, Parmesan cheese almost always has a better taste if purchased
in a block and cut or shredded when it is ready to be used.
It is also best to avoid parmesan in bottles or shakers as most of these blends
are packed with additional ingredients and fillers such as cellulose.

    Labels can be misleading when buying inferior or cheaper parmesan blends
