Gruyere Cheese
==============
Gruyere cheese is a type of Swiss cheese that is meant to be a table cheese,
meaning that it can be eaten in slices, like on a sandwich or as part of a
cheese platter. It also is a great cheese for melting and as a result is very
commonly used to make fondues.


History
-------
It is made from whole milk and is generally cured
for a minimum of six months or longer. Unlike other swiss cheeses its holes are
generally much smaller. The reason that this cheese melts so well is because of
the process used to create it. The cheese is made from milk which is curdled,
the curdled milk is then separated and the curds are squeezed to force the water
out of them. Cheeses curdled with enzymes known as rennet will melt,
while those curdled with acid like ricotta will not melt. They also say that
depending on how much water is in the cheese will tell how well it will melt,
the cheeses with higher water contents tend to melt better than those that
contain less water.


Taste Review
------------
The gruyere cheese that I am reviewing is a Culinary Tours brand cheese.
This cheese has been aged four months to the point of near perfection. The
cheese is firm and almost flaky. This cheese also has very small holes. On the
nose it is very mild smelling and smells much like the other Swiss cheeses that
I have had in the past. The taste is as mild as the smell and yet as one chews
on it it becomes stronger and stronger. It is a very firm cheese, and it
chews much differently than a lot of other cheeses that I have had in a long time.
I enjoy this taste and it would make a great base for soups or as toppings for a
sandwich, or on the top of a cracker as part of a cheese board.
