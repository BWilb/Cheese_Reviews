Swiss Cheese
=============
Swiss cheese is a style of cheese, originating from Switzerland. It's most likely
to appear white or yellow with decent sized holes all around a slice or chunk
of Swiss. Its the type of cheese that's most likely shown up in old fashioned
cartoons involving mice and cats, like Tom and Jerry.

History of Swiss Cheese
------------------------
Swiss cheese was developed in Switzerland around the 14th century. Before then
cheese makers had been making cheese since Neolithic times. As Swiss people
began to incorporate more foods into their diet, specific cheeses gain surpluses.
This allowed cheeses made in Switzerland to travel outside of Switzerland and into
neighboring territories.

Taste
----------
Whenever I eat a slice of swiss cheese, the initial bite tastes really bland.
However, when I chew the bite more and more, the flavor starts to take shape.
Swiss cheese has a sweet curdled taste, similar to cheese topping found in Italian
pizza restaurants. If you really focus in on the taste, you can also sense
a buttery flavor as well.

Smell
------
Swiss cheese has a more authentic smell than american cheese. The aroma of the
smell makes it seem as if the cheese had just been freshly produced and come straight
from the manufacturing warehouse. Swiss cheese's mild smell also prevents me from
feeling like I want to vomit after placing it in my mouth, unlike american cheese.
This would probably be due to the smell receptors in the back of my throat; that
every human does have.
