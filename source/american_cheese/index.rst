American Cheese
================
American cheese is commonly referred to as a processed cheese, instead of either
a soft or hard cheese. It can either be served as a single slice or chunks.
This style of cheese often contains a white or yellow tint.

History
-------

Taste
----------
For many people, american cheese tastes like plastic. This is probably due to the
fact that this type of cheese contains highly processed ingredients. For some people
eating american cheese can be overstimulating, since every processed ingredient is
coming at them at once. The cheese immediately melts in your mouth, which contributes
to the overstimulating taste. The immediate melting can also cause the cheese
to take on a mushy yogurt texture as well.

Smell
----------
Unlike other cheeses, American cheese has a very unique smell. It smells like
highly processed fats mixed with milk. However, it also has a slight curdled cheddar
smell, similar to that of string cheese.
