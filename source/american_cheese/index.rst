American Cheese
================
American cheese(left off on thought).

History
-------

Taste
----------
For many people, american cheese tastes like plastic. This is probably due to the
fact that this type of cheese contains highly processed ingredients. This thought
is the same for me. When I first bit into the piece of cheese, it quickly melted
into a semi-liquid state. Some people prefer this style of taste, but I don't. I prefer a type
of cheese that remains somewhat solid, even after chewing for awhile.

Smell
----------
Unlike other cheeses, American cheese has a very unique smell. It smells like
highly processed fats mixed with milk. However, it also has a slight curdled cheddar
smell, similar to that of string cheese.

    to improve your experience with american cheese, eat it on a sandwich!!!!
