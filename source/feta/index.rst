Feta Cheese [#f1]_.

Description
-----------

Feta cheese is usually produced from either goat or sheep's milk, but there are cow's milk
varieties as well. It is a soft white brined cheese with a nutty strong aroma. While textures and flavors
vary from region to region, most commonly the texture can be described as crumbly and grainy with a
salty and tangy taste. The taste comes from the brine or pickled solution the block of cheese
is submerged in.

Feta is commonly found in salads and pizzas - :ref:`feta_recipes`

History
-------

Feta Cheese is one of the oldest known cheeses [#f2]_. Around 8,000 years ago in Greece
when people began domesticating animals such as goats, cows and sheep, the cheese making process
was discovered, probably much by accident. The legends of how feta cheese was first created
are very tied to Greek mythology. The stories tell of a son of Apollo sent by the gods to
teach humans how to make cheese. This first cheese then directly led to the creation of feta
and the process has not changed much since then.

Only cheese manufactured in the Greek regions of Macedonia, Thrace, Thessaly, Central Mainland Greece,
The Peloponnese, Lesvos and Island of Kefalonia are legally allowed to be called 'feta'. Other cheeses
made by similar processed outside of these regions are often called 'white cheese' instead.

Feta cheese is a great source of calcium and phosphorus. It also contains other necessary minerals
such as iron, magnesium, zinc and potassium. However there are some health concerns
with the high cholesterol, saturated fat, and sodium content.
