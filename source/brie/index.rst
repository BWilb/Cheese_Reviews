Brie Cheese
===========

Brie is a soft and creamy cheese that originated in France and is traditionally
made from cow milk but can also be made from the milk of goats as well. It has
a rind of white mold which is considered a delicacy. Originating in
Seine-et-Marne as a farmhouse cheese it has a rich flavor that contains notes
of butter, fruit, and as it ages it becomes more and more earthy through time.

History
-------
Authentic French Brie cannot be imported into the United States as it is made
with raw cow milk, which would require it to be aged for 60 days to be legal for
importation, which would make it past its time for eating. Luckily there is a
stabilized version of the delicious spread that France exports so that the US
markets don’t miss out completely on French Brie. The difference between raw
and pasteurized milks means that the cheese becomes generally milder in
flavor than authentic French brie


Uses
----
It is generally served at room temperature alongside fruit, crackers, nuts and
other cheeseboard accouterments and it can be also served baked wrapped in
pastry and served with bread and fruit or in gratins, casseroles, sauces,
grilled cheese sandwiches, and panini, or on pizzas and flatbreads.


Taste Review
------------
The Brie that I am reviewing is French style Culinary Tours double cream Brie.
On the nose it is a strong smelling cheese, this cheese doesn’t mess around
with its pine notes. It is a mild yellow and white rind, and is very spongy
inside while the rind is tough. This cheese is really nice and smooth.
While cold, it is much harder than usual to spread but that is to be expected.
On tasting it is bold and yet soft at the same time.
It had hints of nuttiness and an interesting hint of what I can only describe
as pine. This cheese is really intriguing, as it is so smooth, and at the same
time has such a powerful taste. The rind is tough and even more full of taste
that the rest of the cheese holds. The white mold rind is absolutely delicious
and has all the taste that I was expecting. I wonder how this would stack against
the cheeses from France. This cheese would pair nicely with crackers and a
nice red wine. Especially on the flowing fields of France, as part of
a picnic in the hills.
