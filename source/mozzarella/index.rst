Mozzarella
==========


Description
-----------

Mozzarella is a white cheese that is commonly sold in ball forms, and never
with a rind. Due to how fresh it is right after the creation process, it does
not need to be handled any further to avoid ruining it.


History
-------

Originating from Southern Italy, Mozzarella is a cheese that has a long line
history dating back to the Romans who produced a similar cheese. It was made
from sheep milk but then eventually changed to be created from buffalo milk.

Mozzarella became more popular during the 20th century across Europe, which is
why they began using the milk of other animals to produce it.

The name mozzarella comes from the word "mozzatura" which defines the act to
"cut something by hand".
