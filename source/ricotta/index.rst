Ricotta Cheese [#f1]_.

Description
-----------

Ricotta commonly looks like cottage cheese, but varies a lot more than most would think. It is a very soft cheese that
has a creamy taste to it. Ricotta is a cheese that is cooked more than once, thus technically making a curd type of
cheese. *Humorously it is considered to be the fluffy cheese clouds of the dairy world.*

History
-------
Ricotta is a popular cheese across the United States and it originates from Italy. It is made from all different types
of animal’s milk and is known as a `“whey cheese.” <https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-ricotta-cheese>`_

This term breaks down how milk gets separated and becomes curdled. Then there is a remaining liquid called whey that remains after the cooking process.
The name ricotta translates to English as “recooked” which helps understand and refer to the process of how the cheese is made.

Recipes
-------

Ricotta is delicious for cheesecakes, ravioli, and lasagna as it provides a lighter and slightly sweeter taste.

This cheese is extremely easy and is great to make at home. These ingredients might already be in your home:


- Whole milk.

- Whole-milk yogurt.

- White vinegar.

- Salt.

1.	Begin by stirring everything together in a pot.

2.	Heat it on high on the stove and boil it for a few minutes.

3.	After the milk is curdled, pour the boiled mixture into a strainer on top of a few layers of cheesecloth.

4.	Let the substance sit in the strainer for at least 15 minutes to ensure it rests enough.

5.	Grab the cheesecloth and gently squeeze to drain as much liquid as possible.
